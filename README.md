# zendeskbot

***Note: This project is under acive development and is not yet complete***

This is a simple project meant to pull data in from the Zendesk API and push to an LED screen. This was developed in Python. Hardware is the Pimoroni Scroll Bot kit: https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/scroll-bot-pi-zero-w-project-kit

For this project, you'll need:

* Agent access to Zendesk
* A Zendesk Token
* A fully built [Pimoroni Scroll Bot](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/scroll-bot-pi-zero-w-project-kit)
* A Python IDE (if you want to change anything or test things out). I use [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)
